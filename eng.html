                An undying spiral of desire stirs<br>
                Cracking walls, thumping on every drum beat <br>
                My Wings spread, clinging to the fondness that spurs <br>

                Chambers of the secrets to my heart go erratic<br>
                Memories of you, a reverie so mystifyingly inescapable<br>
                Shall I hold your hair in the gentlest of ways? For you, I become a fanatic<br>
                The weight of my love to the Pacific Ocean, unbreakable<br>
                
                Neither universe nor obstacle can halt my passion from going course<br>
                For in my heart, all it screams is “I wanna be yours”</p><br>

                Contentment a shadow to your every whereabout, spoken pleas break <br>
                Control teeters the brink, in that deep mystery of yours is my presence worth endearing?  <br>

                When nightfall strikes, so do darlings arose<br>
                A scrawl familiar to one’s touch and glance<br>
                Azure apparel warms you as you prance<br>
                Laced match with your stockings for one’s
                repose<br>
                The mist of the exhausted flame remains<br>
                Of ribald spirit crimping yore’s remorse<br>
                Defiant teases you ignite for pain<br>
                Lasting allies though you seem to refrain <br>
                A throne split in between I shall enforce<br>
                For you, my precious jewel I have attained</p><br>

                  <b>LYRICS:</b><br>
                  Well, you cured my January blues <br>
                  Yeah, you made it all alright <br>
                  I've got a feelin' I might have lit the very <br>
                  fuse <br>
                  That you were tryin' not to light <br>
                  You were a stranger in my phonebook I was <br>
                  actin' like I knew <br>
                  'Cause I had nothin' to lose <br>
                  When the winter's in full swing and <br>
                  Your dreams just aren't comin' true <br>
                  Ain't it funny what you'll do? <br>
                  When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock <br>
                  When you know who's callin' even though <br>
                  the number is blocked <br>
                  When you walked around your house <br>
                  wearin' my sky blue Lacoste <br>
                  And your knee socks <br>
                  The late afternoon, the ghost in your room <br>
                  That you always thought didn't approve <br>
                  Of you knockin' boots <br>
                  Never stopped you lettin' me get hold <br>
                  Of the sweet spot by the scruff of your <br>
                  Knee socks <br>
                  You and me could have been a team <br>
                  Each had a half of a king and queen seat <br>
                  Like the beginnin' of Mean Streets <br>
                  You could be my baby <br>
                  You and me could have been a team <br>
                  Each had a half of a king and queen seat <br>
                  Like the beginnin' of Mean Streets <br>
                  You could be my baby
